				<p>Hi! I'm a fourth year graduate student in the Yale Psychology Department. I'm currently a member of Dr. Julian Jara-Ettinger's Computational Social Cognition Lab, and Dr. Frank Keil's Cognitive Development Lab. I'm interested in social cognition broadly, but in the bulk of my work I study how children infer what someone knows or believes, simply from observing that person act in the world. See below for descriptions of three current lines of work:

            <h2> How do we infer others' mental states? 
                <p style = "font-size: 75%;"> Although even young children can represent others' beliefs, less work has investigated whether kids can <i>infer</i> what others know or believe. I'm really interested in understanding these types of mental-state inferences. I've found that kids understand the <a href = "Aboody, Huey & Jara-Ettinger (2018) Success != Knowledge.pdf" class = "external">types of actions that reveal knowledge</a>, and have <a href = "Aboody, Flowers, Zhou & Jara-Ettinger (2019) - Ignorance = doing what is reasonable.pdf" class = "external">intuitions about what it means to be ignorant</a>.

            <h2> How do we deal with social information?
                <p style = "font-size: 75%;"> Often, we form our opinions based on things others have told us. When deciding what to believe, do we just listen to what people say, or do we also consider <i>why</i> they said it? We find that adults often don't <a href = "Yousif, Aboody & Keil (2019) - False Consensus.pdf" class = "external">distinguish between information that is independently sourced vs. merely repeated</a>, weighting both equally.

                <p style = "font-size: 75%;"> Although humans are incredibly good at transmitting information, we're not always perfect. Why do we sometimes make mistakes? In one set of studies, we find evidence for a <a href = "Aboody, Velez-Ginorio, Santos & Jara-Ettinger (2018) - Pedagogy.pdf" class = "external">Curse of Knowledge in teaching</a>: adults assume that learners' hypothesis spaces are fairly narrow. Because of this, they don't provide enough evidence for learners to learn.
