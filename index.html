				<p>Hi! I'm a fourth year graduate student in the Yale Psychology Department. I'm currently a member of Dr. Julian Jara-Ettinger's Computation and Cognitive Development Lab, and Dr. Frank Keil's Cognitive Development Lab. I'm interested in social cognition broadly, but in the bulk of my work I study how children infer what someone knows or believes, simply from observing that person act in the world. See below for descriptions of three current lines of work:

            <h2> How do we infer others' mental states? 
            <p style = "font-size: 75%;"> Although even young children can represent others' beliefs, less work has investigated whether kids can <i>infer</i> what others know or believe. I'm really interested in understanding these types of mental-state inferences. I've found that kids understand the <a href = "Aboody, Huey & Jara-Ettinger (2018) Success != Knowledge.pdf">types of actions that reveal knowledge</a>, and have <a href = "Aboody, Flowers, Zhou & Jara-Ettinger (2019) - Ignorance = doing what is reasonable.pdf">intuitions about what it means to be ignorant</a>.

            <h2> How do we deal with social information?
            <p style = "font-size: 75%;"> Often, we form our opinions based on things others have told us. When deciding what to believe, do we listen just to what people say? Or do we also consider <i>why</i> they said it? We find that adults often don't <a href = "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797619856844?fbclid=IwAR28DlVBFy0cNnuOkOZ0IpOJsDmBSClW0YHrsHjBZEnFhfLGAc16HI7N5ic">distinguish between information that is independently sourced vs. merely repeated</a>, weighting both equally. Ongoing work tests children's abilities.
