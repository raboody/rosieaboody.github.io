				<p>I'm an incoming postdoctoral fellow at Harvard & MIT, working with Drs. Elizabeth Bonawitz, Tomer Ullman, and Laura Schulz. Previously, I completed my PhD at Yale, working primarily with Dr. Julian Jara-Ettinger in the <a href = "https://compdevlab.yale.edu/", class = "nav" target = "_break">Computational Social Cognition Lab</a>. I'm interested in social cognition broadly, but in the bulk of my work I study how children and adults infer what someone knows or believes, simply from observing that person act in the world. See below for descriptions of three current lines of work:

            <h2> How do we infer others' mental states? 
                <p style = "font-size: 75%;"> Although even young children can represent others' beliefs, less work has investigated whether kids can <i>infer</i> what others know or believe. I'm really interested in understanding these types of mental-state inferences. I've found that kids expect others to <a href = "https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.13557" class = "external" target = "_break">maximize epistemic trade-offs</a>, and understand the types of actions that reveal both <a href = "_Papers/Aboody, Huey & Jara-Ettinger (2018) Success != Knowledge.pdf" class = "external" target = "_break"> knowledge</a> and <a href = "_Papers/Aboody, Flowers, Zhou & Jara-Ettinger (2019) - Ignorance = doing what is reasonable.pdf" class = "external" target = "_break">ignorance</a>.

            <h2> How do we deal with social information?
                <p style = "font-size: 75%;"> Often, we form our opinions based on things others have told us. When deciding what to believe, do we just listen to what people say, or do we also consider <i>why</i> they said it? We find that adults often don't distinguish between information that is<a href = "_Papers/Yousif, Aboody & Keil (2019) - False Consensus.pdf" class = "external" target = "_break"> independently sourced vs. merely repeated</a>.

                <p style = "font-size: 75%;"> Although humans are incredibly good at transmitting information, we're not always perfect. Why do we sometimes make mistakes? In one set of studies, we find evidence for a <a href = "_Papers/Aboody, Velez-Ginorio, Santos & Jara-Ettinger (2018) - Pedagogy.pdf" class = "external" target = "_break">Curse of Knowledge in teaching</a>: adults assume that learners' hypothesis spaces are fairly narrow.
