        		<h1>Rosie Aboody</h1>
				<p>Hi! I'm a fourth year graduate student in the Yale Psychology Department. I'm currently a member of Dr. Julian Jara-Ettinger's Computation and Cognitive Development Lab, and Dr. Frank Keil's Cognitive Development Lab. I'm interested in social cognition broadly, but in the bulk of my work I study how children infer what someone knows or believes, simply from observing that person act in the world. See below for descriptions of three current lines of work:

            <h2> How do we infer others' mental states? 
                <p style = "font-size: 75%;"> Although even young children can represent others' beliefs, less work has investigated whether kids can <i>infer</i> what others know or believe. I'm really interested in understanding these types of mental-state inferences. I've found that kids understand the <b href = "Aboody, Huey & Jara-Ettinger (2018) Success != Knowledge.pdf">types of actions that reveal knowledge</b>, and have <b href = "Aboody, Flowers, Zhou & Jara-Ettinger (2019) - Ignorance = doing what is reasonable.pdf">intuitions about what it means to be ignorant</b>.

            <h2> How do we deal with social information?
                <p style = "font-size: 75%;"> Often, we form our opinions based on things others have told us. When deciding what to believe, do we listen just to what people say? Or do we also consider <i>why</i> they said it? We find that adults often don't <b href = "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797619856844?fbclid=IwAR28DlVBFy0cNnuOkOZ0IpOJsDmBSClW0YHrsHjBZEnFhfLGAc16HI7N5ic">distinguish between information that is independently sourced vs. merely repeated</b>, weighting both equally. We test children's abilities in ongoing work.

            <h2> How do we deal with social information?
                <p style = "font-size: 75%;"> Although the human species is incredibly good at transmitting information, we're not always perfect. Why do we sometimes make mistakes? In one set of studies, we find evidence for a <b href = "Aboody, Velez-Ginorio, Santos & Jara-Ettinger (2018) - Pedagogy.pdf">Curse of Knowledge in teaching</b>: adults assume that learners' hypothesis spaces are fairly narrow. Because of this, they don't provide enough evidence for learners to learn.
