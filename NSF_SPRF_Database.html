	<p style = "font-size:110%">Typically, example grant materials are shared informally, passing between labmates and friends. There are many valid reasons why individuals might not wish to make past grant materials public. However, this means that in general, only students who are already well-connected get to consult past examples when writing their own grants—an unintentional but serious equity issue. The individuals below have generously agreed to share their grant materials, in hopes that these materials will help future students, especially those who do not have other means to access such examples.</p>

	<p style = "font-size:110%">A note to users: you will notice that we list a lot of information about each grant, including whether it was awarded or not. We hope this highlights the ultimately luck-based nature of getting grants—if you're attentive, you might notice that awarded and unawarded grants generally do not differ in quality. This is a good thing to keep in mind as you write your own grants: do your best, but know that in the end, this is a fairly random process, and so the outcome is not a comment on your merit or abilities.
