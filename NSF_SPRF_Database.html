	<p style = "font-size:110%">Typically, example grant materials are shared informally, passing between labmates and friends. There are many valid reasons why individuals might not wish to make past grant materials public. However, this means that in general, only students who are already well-connected get to consult past examples when writing their own grantsâ€”an unintentional but serious equity issue. The individuals below have generously agreed to share their grant materials, in hopes that these materials will help future students, especially those who do not have other means to access such examples.</p>
